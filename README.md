Idea and Purpose of the AI Weather Nowcasting Project

Idea:

The project is about creating a smart AI system that predicts weather changes, focusing on heavy rain, thunderstorms, and cloudbursts in India using data from Doppler Weather Radars. The system will analyze radar images taken every few minutes and use machine learning to forecast weather conditions for the next 0-2 hours. This will generate detailed weather maps to show where and when rain or storms might occur, enabling quick preparation and response.


Purpose:

Weather nowcasting is crucial because it provides fast and accurate updates about sudden weather changes, which can save lives and protect property. In India, where heavy rains and cloudbursts often lead to floods, landslides, and other disasters—especially in cities like Mumbai, Chennai, and hilly regions—having a reliable prediction system is essential. Traditional weather forecasts can be too slow or vague for short-term events, but this AI tool will offer real-time warnings for the next 0-2 hours. This can help:

i. Save Lives: Give people and authorities time to move to safety or prepare for floods within the critical 2-hour window.

ii. Protect Property: Help farmers, businesses, and cities minimize damage from sudden storms.

iii. Support Decision-Making: Assist the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and local governments in planning quick evacuations or emergency actions.

iv. Improve Safety: Reduce risks for people in vulnerable areas by predicting dangerous weather before it strikes.

By tailoring the system to India’s unique weather patterns and using local radar data, this project aims to make weather predictions more reliable and actionable, especially during the monsoon season when extreme weather is frequent.
